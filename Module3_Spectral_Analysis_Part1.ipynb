    "When we are looking at any astronomical object what we are really doing is studying the light from that object. The light we recieve provides us with valuable information about the chemical composition, the strength of the ionization field that leads to emission lines, as well as information about the dust properties within a galaxy and so much more. When we are studying galaxies, in escense, what we are studying is the summation of all the light emitted (typically by stars) in that galaxy as well as all the post processing of that light through dust and gas. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How do we measure a Spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically when we measure a spectra, we use a slit. A slit is an optical mask that allow light through a small area (the slit) and blocks light from all other areas. The image below shows an example of a slit. With the rectangle shown where the spectrograph is getting the light from the galaxy.\n",

    "![alt text](slit_dispersions.png \"Shutter\")\n",
    "[citation](https://users.physics.unc.edu/~gcsloan/research/longslit.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "The light from the galaxy enters the box or $\\textbf{slit}$ before encountering a disperser that spreads out the light as a function of wavelength. At each wavelength we measure the number of photons that hit the detector, and the resulting distribution of intensity of light as a function of wavelegnth (or frequency) is a spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, spectra are two-dimensional (2D) with a spatial axis (measuring position along the slit) and spectral axis (measuring the wavelength (or frequency) of light). One can think of a 2D spectrum as a series of images of the slit, each containing a specific wavelenght of light, all lined up in a row from shortest to longest wavelength. An example of a 2D spectrum is shown below in the upper panel of the below figure. \n",

    "2D spectra are useful for more advanced spectral analysis, but typically, one collapses a 2D spectrum into a 1D spectrum for most applications. This is done by summing the flux in each column of the spectrum to form a 1D array of total fluxes as a function of wavelength (see lower panel). As such, note that the wavelenghts with high flux (colored purple in the 2D spectrum) therefore correspond to wavelengths with high flux in the 1D spectrum. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Spectral Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important aspect of a spectroscopic instrument is the resolution. You can think of the resolution of an instrument as how finely separated are two neighboring wavelengths. The higher the resolution the smaller the spacing between neighboring wavelengths. This is super important if you need to be able to resolve doublets, which are two emission lines in very close proximity. If the resolution is really low you can imaging that doublets would actually look like one line instead of two. There are ways to fit emission lines with multi-Gaussian when the resolution is low and back out information, with some assumption, which we will cover in the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see an example of the difference that resolution makes in the following image where with a higher resolution spectra you can really make out the individual emission features but if you have a lower resolution spectra the lines can blur together and gaining information from that spectra is more difficult, but not impossible.\n",

    "# What does a Spectra Tell Us?\n",
    "\n",
    "A spectrum is a superposition of everything emitting and absorbing light. The components that make up a spectrum are the continuum, emission and absorption features. Let's cover each of them in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Continuum\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that gets discussed early on in astrophysics is the fact that stars are as close to a black body as possible. That means that they emit light across a wide range of wavelengths and they emit this light in a particular way and shape. Each star has a peak wavelength where the intensity of this light is the maximum. When we look at a spectrum of a star the overall shape or continuum, is determined by the star's temperature and follows a blackbody curve as shown below. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](stellar_continuum.png \"continuum\")\n",
    "\n",
    "[citation](http://spiff.rit.edu/classes/phys301/lectures/blackbody/blackbody.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "While stars are close to being blackbody emitters they are not exactly, as you can see in the plot above. There is additional spikes and dips and that is due to elements in the stars absorbing and emitting some of the star light, as well as instrumental noise adding some fluctuations to the star light.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at a galaxy spectrum what we are seeing is a summation of all the stars conttibuting to the continuum and every star contributes differently. The highest mass stars ($> 50 M_{\\odot}$), for example, contributes more of their light to the UV-wavelengths, where lower mass stars contribute more to the optical and infrared. So the shape of the continuum for a galaxy is not a simple black-body curve like a star but a summation of a lot of black body and depending on the populations of stars within the galaxy can alter the shape of the continuum we see from galaxy to galaxy. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I told you that high mass stars emit more UV light than less massive stars. So if a galaxy has lots of high mass stars then we would expect the UV continuum would be higher than a galaxy that does not have as many high mass stars. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: it is not that the stars do not emit at these wavelengths, but their contribution at those wavelengths is less than other stars"

    "## Emission and Absorption Lines\n",
    "\n",
    "When the light from a star encounters some cold gas as it makes its way to our detector the intermediate gas can absorb some of the light, this absorption can only occur at very discrete energy levels or at discrete wavelengths. What this does is that the electrons in the gas go from their ground state energy level to a level with higher energy or to an excited state. Since this light that we would normally would have seen got absorbed by the gas we will see a dip in the intensity of light around the wavelength that got absorbed. Because we see a dip and the cause is from atoms absorbing the light we call these Absorption Lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "The complement of these are emission lines and the way we get this is that you have gas in an excited state (so not the ground state), this upper energy level is not very stable for atoms and the electrons want to go back to the ground state. So what the electrons do is that they go from a higher energy level to a lower level and in the process they emit a photon that exactly matches the difference in energy between the two levels. This occurs at very specific wavelengths, very similar to the absorption mechanism, and as a result we will see a boost in the signal at those specific wavelengths since this gas is adding photons at that particular wavelength. This results in a spike in the spectrum.\n"

Those lines occur at a fixed wavelength and we can measure how far off those emission lines are from where they are from the rest frame. By using the equation below we can get the redshift. \n",

    "$z = \\lambda_{obs}/\\lambda_{rest} - 1$\n",

We recommend you look at this [page](http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/drewski/tableofemissionlines.html) to get a sense of all the emission lines people have found in astrophysical objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Astrophysical Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of those emission lines can give us insight into the properties of the astrophysical source we are looking at. By measuring the flux of lines across the spectra and by using certain equations we can get relevant properties like; metallicity, ionization parameter, dust content, star formation rate (SFR for short), and more. \n",
    "\n",
    "The way that we measure the flux of an emission line is by fitting the line to a Gaussian Model as emission lines are really well modeled by a Gaussian. The integral of this Gaussian will tell you the integrated flux of this line. Depending on the line you can measure properties from this single line alone or you would need to measure other lines and and use line ratios to back out physical properties. We cover in this notebook how to fit an emission line to a Gaussian Model using curve_fit and in part 2 and 3 how we can use a Bayesian model to perform the fitting. "

    "# A Note on Units\n",

    "When dealing with spectra they will most likely come in one of two flux units: $F_{\\nu}$ or $F_{\\lambda}$. The units for each of these differ slightly where in $F_{\\nu}$ the base cgs unit is $erg/s/cm^2/Hz$, other units are scaled versions of this base unit such as a Jansky (Jy for short) which is 1 $\\times$ $10^{-23}$ $erg/s/cm^2/Hz$. The typical fluxes observed in distant galaxies are of order $10^{-30}$ - $10^{-26}$ for $erg/s/cm^2/Hz$. \n",

    "In $F_{\\lambda}$, the base cgs unit is $erg/s/cm^2/\\AA$. The typical fluxes observed in distant galaxies in these units are of order $10^{-21}$ - $10^{-16}$ in $erg/s/cm^2/\\AA$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting Between the Two\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things we will be working on in this notebook, and whenever you are dealing with spectra, is measuring the flux of a source for that we need the units to be in units of $erg/s/cm^2$. This means that if you are measuring fluxes, you will need to be careful about the units of the spectrum you are fitting. If you have a spectrum that is in $F_{\\nu}$ and you need to get to $F_{\\lambda}$ the way to do that is to apply the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $ F_{\\lambda} = \\frac{c}{\\lambda^2} F_{\\nu}$\n",

    "   Where $F_{\\nu}$ is in $erg/s/cm^2/Hz$, c is the speed of light in Angstroms/second, and $\\lambda$ is in Angstroms. \n",

    "To go the other way from $F_{\\lambda}$ to $F_{\\nu}$ we do the following equation:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Where $F_{\\lambda}$ is in units of $erg/s/cm^2/\\AA$, c is the speed of light in Angstroms/second. If your spectrum does not have wavelengths but frequency you can always use the relation of the speed of light $c = \\lambda \\nu$ to change one of the variables to the other."

    "# 2. Fitting/Removing the Continuum\n",
    "\n",
    "The continuum holds the shape of the underlying stellar population of a galaxy but it does mess up our ability to measure the flux of a line properly so what we need to do is to somehow fit the broad shape of the continuum so that we can perform accurate line fitting. One technique is applying a broad window filter that will smooth out all the local bumps and wiggles to get the shape of the continuum. You will need to mess around with the optimal window as a window that is too small will reproduce emission and absorption features and we do not want that or a window that is too large will overly smooth so some trial and error is needed to get it just right. Also If you see prominant emission lines in your spectra it would be wise to mask them out (remove them) from the spectra when doing this continuum fitting. This spectra does not have any large emission features so we will just use the broad window filter"

    "\n",
    "Curve fit is a very powerful tool to fit any model to any kind of data. The power of curve_fit comes from the ability to have a custom model that the user can create. The one condition for this function that the user defines is just that it has to be in the format that curve_fit expects it in. The format for this function is f(x, param1, param2, ...) where x is the first argument in the function and then the rest are the parameters you are trying to fit in any order you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the purpose of fitting an emission line we will be fitting a Gaussian to this and so our model will have the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$G(x) = Ae^{\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here A represents the amplitude of the Gaussian and controls the height of the Gaussian. $\\mu$ controls where the Gaussian is centered and this should correspond to the wavelength of the emission line. $\\sigma$ controls how wide the emission line is, a larger value of $\\sigma$ means a broader line. x in this example corresponds to your wavelength array. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the units of A, $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ are solely determined by the data you provide curve_fit. So if the spectra is in units of Jy then the Amplitude will have units of Jy, if the wavelength inputted is in microns then $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ will be in microns. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function curve_fit takes in some parameters and then you can customize it further with other key-word arguments. The basic input to get curve_fit to start fitting is it needs the model that you are trying to fit in the format specified above, the x and y data, and an intitial guess to start the process to finding the best fit parameters.\n",

The thing we are really after is the best fit parameters so we will not cover the covariance matrix in too much detail as we will be using more sophisticated ways of getting the error on our parameters in the upcoming notebooks.\n",
