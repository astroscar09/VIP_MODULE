    "# Introduction to Spectral Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "As astronomers our main bread and better comes when we are able to study light from an object. This light gives us invaluable information about the chemical composition, the strength of the ionization field that leads to emission lines, as well as information about the dust properties within a galaxy and so much more. When we are studying galaxies in escense what we are studying is the summation of all the stars that make up the galaxy as well as all the post processing of that light through dust and gas. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How do we take a Spectrum\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically when we take a spectra, we apply what is called a mask. You can think of this mask as being a small little rectangular box that.The image below shows an example of this using the NIRSpec instrument on JWST. With the rectangle shown where the spectrograph is getting the light from the galaxy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The light from the galaxy enters the box or $\\textbf{slit}$ and then it encounters a disperser that spreads out the light at different wavelength. At each wavelength we measure the amount of photons that hot the detector and there are certain wavelength that have more strength than the surrounding area and these areas of a boost in strength are typically called $\\textbf{Emission Line}$. Which come from the recombination of atoms in the galaxy providing a boost in signal at specific wavelengths. You can also see a reduction in flux from the surrounding areas and this is what is called $\\textbf{Absorption Lines}$. The Absorption Lines typically come about when light from stars encounters relatively cool gas, that gas then absorbs the light and moves the atom to an excited state, and when it decays back to the ground state the light is emitted in a random direction which, most of the time, removes the light from our line of sight. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the light encounters our detector this is done on a 2D Charge-Coupled Device or CCD, so when we get the spectra it is not a 1D spectra that we are all familiar with but a 2D spectra as seen below:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Spectral Resolution\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important aspect of a spectroscopic instrument is the resolution. You can think of the resolution of an instrument as how finely separated are two neighboring wavelengths. The higher the resolution the smaller the spacing between neighboring wavelengths. This is super important if you need to be able to resolve doublets, which are two emission lines in very close proximity. If the resolution is really low you can imaging that doublets would actually look like one line instead of two. There are ways to fit emission lines with multi-Gaussian when the resolution is low and back out information, with some assumption, which we will cover in the end of the notebook.\n",
    "You can see an example of the difference that resolution makes in the following image where with a higher resolution spectra you can really make out the individual emission features where if you have a lower resolution spectra the lines can blur together and gaining information from that spectra is more difficult, but not impossible.\n",

    "Spectra tell us so much information. For one, we can use the spectra to find the redshift of the source. Do you see those vertical dashed lines in the 1D-spectra above? Those lines occur at a fixed wavelength and we can measure how far off those emission lines are from where they are from the rest frame and we can use the equation below to get the redshift. \n",

    "2. Galaxy Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The strength of those emission lines can give us insight into the internal galaxy properties. By measuring the flux of lines across the spectra and by using certain equations we can get relevant galaxy properties like; metallicity, ionization parameter, dust content, Star Formation Rate, and more. The way that we measure the flux of an emission line is by fitting the line to a Gaussian Model as emission lines are really well modeled by a Gaussian. The integral of this Gaussian will tell you the integrated flux of this line. Depending on this line you can measure properties from this single line or you would need to measure other lines and pair this line with that to get galaxy properties. We cover in this notebook how to fit a line to a Gaussian Model and in part 2, how we can use a Bayesian model for the fitting. "

    "# A Note on Units\n",
    "\n",
    "When dealing with spectra they will most likely come in two flux units $F_{\\nu}$ or $F_{\\lambda}$. The units for each of these differ slightly where in $F_{\\nu}$ the base cgs unit is $erg/s/cm^2/Hz$, other units are scaled versions of this base unit such as a Jansky (Jy for short) which is 1 $\\times$ $10^{-23}$ $erg/s/cm^2/Hz$. The typical order of magnitude for these sources is of order $10^{-30}$ - $10^{-26}$ for $erg/s/cm^2/Hz$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In $F_{\\lambda}$, the base cgs unit is $erg/s/cm^2/\\AA$. The typical order of magnitude of fluxes for spectra in these units is of order $10^{-21}$ - $10^{-16}$ in $erg/s/cm^2/\\AA$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Converting Between the Two\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things we will be working on in this notebook and whenever you are dealing with spectra is measuring the flux of a source for that we need the units to be in units of $erg/s/cm^2$. This means that if you are measuring fluxes, you will need to be careful about the units of the spectrum you are fitting. If you have a spectrum that is in $F_{\\nu}$ and you need to get to $F_{\\lambda}$ the way to do that is to apply the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $ F_{\\lambda} = \\frac{c}{\\lambda^2} F_{\\nu}$\n",
    "\n",
    "   Where $F_{\\nu}$ is in $erg/s/cm^2/\\AA$, c is the speed of light in Angstroms/second, and $\\lambda$ is in Angstroms. \n",
    "\n",
    "To go the other way from $F_{\\lambda}$ to $F_{\\nu}$ we do the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   $ F_{\\nu} = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{c} F_{\\lambda}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $F_{\\lambda}$ is in units of $erg/s/cm^2/\\AA$, c is the speed of light in Angstroms/second. If your spectrum does not have wavelengths but frequency you can always use the relation of the speed of light $c = \\lambda \\nu$ to change one of the variables to the other."

    "\n",
    "The continuum holds the shape of the underlying stellar population of a galaxy but it does mess up our ability to measure the flux of a line properly so what we need to do is to somehow fit the broad shape of the continuum so that we can perform accurate line fitting. One technique is applying a broad window filter that will smooth out all the local bumps and wiggles to get the shape of the continuum. You will need to mess around with the optimal window as a window that is too small will reproduce emission and absorption features and we do not want that or a window that is too large will overly smooth so some trial and error is needed to get it just right. Also If you see prominant emission lines in your spectra it would be wise to mask them out (remove them) from the spectra when doing this continuum fitting. This spectra does not have any large emission features so we will just use the broad window filter"

In the next section we go over how to fit an emission line and slowly increase the complexity of the model and fitting routines."

    "Sometimes a single spectra may not have enough information that we would need to perform a calculation. This can be that an emission feature is too faint to be seen on an individual spectra but it can pop up when we take lots of similar galaxies and stack them. The trick with stacking is that you would want these gaalxies ot be as similar as possible in many properties such as redshift, mass, dust, metallicity, etc. Stacking spectra is essentially taking an average over many spectra and the advatnage to doing stacking is thta you can uncover features that are buried beneath the noise on an individual spectrum. Stacking reduces the noise and increases the signal across the board and below we go over how to do this. You will need an array of wavelengths, fluxes and flux errors. "
