# VIP_MODULE

This repository holds the jupyter notebooks and data for the modules used in the Galaxy Evolution Vertically Integrated Program (GVIP). Students are asked to complete the modules in the following order: Python Bootcamp, Spectroscopy and then the Photometry. 

## Python Bootcamps
In the Python Bootcamp the students should finish the Hogg assignment to demonstrate proficiency in recreating scientific plots through Python. The assignment is to recreate the plots in the Hogg_Paper.pdf, we recommend the students read over the paper to understand the concepts being taught as well as understanding the equations you will need to code up for this assignment. Once you have coded up the plots show them to the grad student mentor so that they can give you the green light to move onto the next module. 


## Spectroscopy Module
There is a couple of Notebook in this repository and we recommend you to look into the notebooks that have **_Part1**, **_Part2**, **_Part3** and we recommend you work through the notebooks in that order. You can feel free to look into the other notebooks but the expectation is that one notbeook will lead to the other. 


## Photometry Module

As of 01/13/25 we have the base notebooks up on the GitHub but we are working on making the file size conform to the limit of GitHub. But feel free to look through the notebooks and check them out but do not expect them to run as we need to also upload the data necessary to make the notebooks run properly.
