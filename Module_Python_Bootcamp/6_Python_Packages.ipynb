    "Boolean masks are a great way to subselect data from an array with ease but it does come at a cost in that when you apply the mask onto an array it alters the size of the array, we started off with an array of length 100 and when we applied the mask it down selected reducing the size of the array. This has important implication if you are working with many different arrays and they need to be the same size for plotting. The way to fix this is that you would need to apply this mask to the other arrays as well to make sure they are the same size and match up for any subsequent analysis and plotting purposes."
