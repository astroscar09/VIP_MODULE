Python and other codes are linear code that go from the top down in order of execution so they encountered the first if statement if MoneyAvailable > price and this evaluated to True since MoneyAvailable = 100 and price = 190 so the code within this if statement does not get executed. Python then goes to the next if statement if MoneyAvailable < price and this evaluates to True so we then go inside the if-block to execute that piece of code.

    "Pass acts as a place holder and really does not do anything so if you just want the code to not run any code but still need to check conditions maybe putting in the pass statement is the way to go. Also as you can see in the example below the pass statement does not affect the code outside it. For this example it is easiest to demonstrate this using a for-loop but do not worry about knowing what a for-loop is for this as we will cover that in the subsequent sections."

In the example below we have the continue in the if statement for when i > 5 and so when this condition is true we no longer see any print statements where i > 5. So using a continue statement is good if you do not want some code to execute given some condition is met. "
