    "1. List\n",
    "2. Tuples\n",
    "3. Dictionaries\n",

    "We covered how to define a list, access the contents of a list and how to change them. We covered how to define a tuple and the small nuance that they cannot be changed once they are created. We covered how to create a dictionary and how to populate the dictionary with key-value pairs and how to change the contents of a dictionary. In the next notebook we will cover how to loop over the contents of containers to perform mathematical operations."
