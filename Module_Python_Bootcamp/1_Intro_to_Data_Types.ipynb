Indexing is a way of accessing a certain element within a string or later list and arrays. We need its location to access the element that we are interested. Python is a unique language in that it uses 0th indexing, which means that the 1st element in the string is actually index 0, instead of index 1. So let us say we have a string like \"Finkelstein\", you can think of indexing as every letter in \"Finkelstein\" being associated with an index based on zero so the index letter association for \"Finkelstein\" is outlined below:\n",
