    "(2) Select pixels where the flux is higher than the background error by a factor of $\\texttt{thresh}$. We'll call them \"significant pixels\".  <br>\n",
    "(3) Find areas where more than $\\texttt{minarea}$ significant pixels are connected together.  <br>\n",

    "This gives us regions of significant fluxes where at least $\\texttt{minarea}$ connected pixels are higher than the background by a factor of $\\texttt{thresh}$. \n",

    "We can change $\\texttt{thresh}$ and $\\texttt{minarea}$ when working with different data sets, as different images will have different properties. Higher $\\texttt{thresh}$ and $\\texttt{minarea}$ will yield fewer but more significant sources, while lower values will yield a larger number of less significant sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another step in source detection is \"deblending\". If two sources are close to each other, their light will overlap in the image, creating a large group of connected significant pixels spanning both sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deblending is controlled by two parameters: **deblend_cont** and **deblend_nthresh**. **deblend_cont** is a number between 0 and 1. The smaller the number, the more aggresively the deblending will be, i.e., the source will be separating into more components. **deblend_cont** =1 will mean no deblending is performed. **deblend_nthresh** is somewhat less important. A value of 32 will usually work.\n",
