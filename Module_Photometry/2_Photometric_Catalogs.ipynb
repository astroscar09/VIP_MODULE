Every photometry file will have different column names but for the most part they all will have a unique ID for each source in the catalog, the coordinate of the source in RA and DEC and the flux of the source in many filters. The flux unit of the source varies form catalog to catalog and that information is typically contained within a file called the README file to outline what each of the column names are and what units the columns are in.

    "With each colored section showing the wavelength coverage that that particular filter spans over and the height of those filter response curves is how much of the light at each wavelength it is able to let through and detect with its detectors. When people work on photometric catalogs what they do is that they take an entire image of a patch of sky in a range of filters. In the case of CEERS they have observed the same patch of the sky using 7 filters: F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M, F444W. These filters only let light through that fall within the filter curves wavelength range and in the previous notebook you covered how we can use tools such as photutils to measure the flux of sources in a particular filter. We do the same procedure that you did in part 1 but for each filter giving us a flux measurement for every source at each filter. Once you have the flux of a source, in  $F_{\\nu}$ units or i other words in units of $erg/s/cm^2/Hz$, it is relatively straight forward to compute the magnitude of the source using the following equation:\n",

However, as mentioned in the previous section, as we go to fainter object it becomes a lot more dificult to know if a source is real or if it a noise spike that mimics a real source. Luckily for us there is a way that we can figure out if a source is significant or not by using the signal-to-noise ratio. The signal-to-noise ratio (or S/N or SNR) is measured by taking the flux of the source and dividing it by the flux error, we then select a threshold and if a source is above this SNR threshold we say that this source is a real source and not a noise spike.

    "Photometric catalogs are the key piece of information that allow us to get a sense of the underlying stellar populations within galaxies due to the ease of acquiring imaging over spectroscopy. In the following section we will go over how to plot the Photometric points to reconstruct the SED or Spectral Energy Distribution of a galaxy. However, before we go into the nitty-gritty details of how to do that it is important to understand how we can use photometry to recreate the SED of a galaxy. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning of this notebook there is a plot that shows the wavelength coverage for each filter. This means that only light that falls within this very specific wavelength window will be detected. So in a way we are getting **ALL** the light within this wavelength range from the galaxy. You can imaging if there are very strong emission lines that happen to fall within the wavelength range of a filter then the amount of flux we measure will be higher, due to emission line, than a galaxy that does not have an emission feature. So in a way we are getting an average flux of the galaxy within this wavelength range. In fact, the mathematical way of getting the average flux from a spectra with flux $F_{\\lambda}$ through a filter curve $T_{\\lambda}$ is: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: The below equation is used if your spectra is in $F_{\\lambda}$ units or $erg/s/cm^2/Angstrom$**\n",
    "\n",
    "$F_{avg}$ = $\\frac{\\int_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2}\\lambda T_{\\lambda} F_{\\lambda} d\\lambda}{\\int_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2}\\lambda T_{\\lambda}d\\lambda}$\n",

    "\n",
    "Most of the time when we plot spectra we plot them as a function of wavelength, so how would we plot the average flux if the filter covers a wide range of wavelength values? The answer to that is by using something called the central wavelength or effective wavelength. In essence what we are doing is we are getting the average wavelength and weighting it by the filter response curve. The formula for the central wavelength or the effective wavelength is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\lambda_{eff}$ = $\\frac{\\int_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2}\\lambda T_{\\lambda} d\\lambda}{\\int_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2}T_{\\lambda} d\\lambda}$\n",

    "You can compute this yourself and we encourage you try this as an exercise but you can also look it up here: http://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/theory/fps/\n",
    "\n",
    "This website has all the filter response curve for a lot of many different telescopes and facilities. To see the central wavelengths for the NIRCAM filters click on the **JWST** tab and select **NIRCAM**, then you should see a table pop up listing all of the filters on NIRCAM. You can find the central wavelength under the $\\lambda_{ref}$ column and note that these wavelengths are in Angstroms. We can then use this central wavelength and the flux in each filter to plot the SED of the galaxy. \n",

For example, if you type in **F105W** you will get one returned match, other filters will give back multiple matches.

Thus we can use colors to select for certain galaxies. For example, we would expect that star forming galaxies be really blue since they are undergoing lots of star formation and the light from a galaxy will be dominated by the hottest stars which shine brightest at the shortest wavelengths or shine brightest at bluer filters than in redder filters. Conversely we can select quiscent galaxies (galaxies that are no longer forming stars) by selecting very red colors as more of the light is becoming dominated by older stars which are most seen in redder wavelengths or redder filters. \n",
